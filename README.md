# CS333-Final Project

### Kyle Knotek - Connect 4 Testing Workflow Pipeline

### To use the testing pipeline:
Make a change in testscript.txt or any file and commit the change to the repository (development_branch). Then go to actions and check if the pipeline fully processed. If sucessful, all of the steps should be completed and test script should have ran. You can check the deployed program with test script output by clicking on the 'Deploy Main Program' step in the workflow.
